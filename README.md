# Welcome to My Instagram
***

## Task
The objective of this project is to build a clone of Instagram using ReactJS for the frontend and AWS Amplify for backend services and database storage. The project is expected to emulate the core functionalities of Instagram, including user authentication, post creation, following users, liking and commenting on posts, messaging, and more. The challenge lies in implementing these features while maintaining a visually appealing design that resembles Instagram and ensuring seamless user experience across all components.

## Description
The MyInstagram Clone project solves the problem of creating a scalable and feature-rich social networking service similar to Instagram. Using ReactJS for the frontend, the app delivers a dynamic, responsive user interface with modern design patterns, while AWS Amplify handles user authentication, database storage, and backend functionality, ensuring that the application is secure and fully hosted in the cloud.

To maintain a high level of user experience and code organization, the project is structured with a focus on reusable and modular components, each associated with its own CSS file for styling. The app mimics core Instagram functionalities such as:

    Login/Signup: Users can create an account, sign in, and reset their passwords.

    Profile Management: Users can switch between private and public accounts, edit their profiles (including bio, social links, and tags), and update their avatar.

    Post Interactions: Users can create posts (images, videos, text, etc.) with various filters and formats, like posts, comment, share, and delete posts.

    Social Features: Users can follow/unfollow others, view suggestions on who to follow, and explore trending posts and users.

    Messaging: Users can engage in conversations with their followers, send messages (text, images, stickers), and manage groups.

    Notifications: Users receive notifications for likes, comments, group invites, and other important actions.

    Search and Explore: Users can search for other users, hashtags, groups, and posts.

The design is user-friendly and creative, with features like mutual likes/comments prioritization and group functionalities. Additionally, the app includes descriptions for actions (such as hovering over the "Like" button to see a description), a "Theatre Mode" for viewing images, and various creative elements to enhance user interaction.
